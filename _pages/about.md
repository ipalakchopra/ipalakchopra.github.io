Hello, I am a PhD scholar at IIT Bombay's CSE department, working under guidance of [Prof. Devashish Gosain](https://www.devashishgosain.com/).
My work focusses on analysis and measurements across web privacy and anonymity networks like Tor. 

I have previously worked on autonomous security solutions, open-source SIEM tools and LLM application security, under the guidance of [Prof. G. Sivakumar](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~siva/).

I let Dan Brown's Digital Fortress influence me a bit too much as a kid (retrospectively it's an alright book at best) and became interested in cybersecurity and privacy. I believe digital institutes need to be held more accountable for how they treat our data.

I am interested in studying the current state of privacy, specifically in India, and what kind of technologies help improve its posture.
