Hello, I am currently a research engineer at IIT Bombay working on  autonomous security solutions, under the guidance of [Prof. G. Sivakumar](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~siva/). I've previously worked on open-source SIEM technologies and LLM application security solutions.

I let Dan Brown's Digital Fortress  (his only book I ever liked) affect me too much as a kid and became interested in cybersecurity and privacy. I believe digital institutes need to be held more accountable for how they treat our data.

I am interested in studying the current state of privacy, specifically in India, and what kind of technologies help improve its posture.
